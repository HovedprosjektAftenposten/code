A car bombing outside the church killed 21 people. Although many still think of Egypts revolution - and the Arab Spring - as a sudden phenomenon that began in Tunisia, several smaller protests over the past decade helped fuel the movement that reached critical mass last January. One such episode was the bombing of a church in Alexandria on Jan. 1 that killed 21 and injured nearly 100 more.
